PyAggregator is a website that aggregates articles about Python from all accross the web.


**Why did I build this?**

I wanted to learn more about web scraping and parsing through HTML.  I also wanted to learn about the process of deploying a Flask application, and this project seemed worth deploying since it's mildly useful.  

**What did I use to build this?**

    -Bootstrap on the front end
    -Flask on the back end
    -I used the BeautifulSoup, Requests, and PRAW Python libraries to scrape the data
